# BrainFuck part 12 - BF self-executables

The goal of this playground is to see how we can have self-executable BF programs (without compilation)

At the end of this playground, you should be able to
* update your source codes to make self-executables BF programs
* leverage a different behavior at input level to add power to other programs

Have fun !
