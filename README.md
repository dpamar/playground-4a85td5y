# BrainFuck part 11 - Iterative and recursive ways

The goal of this playground is to see how recursivity can be added to our code

At the end of this playground, you should be able to
* compute factorial in a basic iterative way
* compute factorial in a recursive way
* compute factorial in a tail-recursive way

Have fun !
